\begin{hcarentry}[updated]{{\tt cab} --- A Maintenance Command of Haskell Cabal Packages}
\report{Kazu Yamamoto}%05/13
\status{open source, actively developed}
\makeheader

{\tt cab} is a MacPorts-like maintenance command of Haskell cabal packages. Some parts of this program are a wrapper to {\tt ghc-pkg}, {\tt cabal}, and {\tt cabal-dev}.

If you are always confused due to inconsistency of {\tt ghc-pkg} and {\tt cabal}, or if you want a way to check all outdated packages, or if you want a way to remove outdated packages recursively, this command helps you.

{\tt cab} now provides the benchmark option (``{\tt -b}'') for the ``{\tt conf}'' subcommand
